Staff/Staff Attitude,Im not going to go as far as to say the therapist shouldnt be in the job she is doing but she didnt seem that interested in listening to me or paying a lot of attention  She also seemed to be trying to put words into my mouth to try to move the situation on  We focused on my work situation but this was just one issue that was effecting by feelings  I went into the therapy hoping to find some real answers as to why i am the way i am and hoped she may at least show me another way of looking at things  But we didnt even cover most of my problems  I feel the sessions were cut short because of this  Also it seems the sessions were cut short due to there being a lack of venue anymore since The Diamond in Kirkby has had to close  Pathetic really  Please do not confuse my opinions as being aimed at the STaR worker  Catherine was great and covered her field well  There is a seperate questionnaire completed for her
Service Quality/Outcomes,When checking in the young person it would be really nice to a be offered a cup of teadrink b to be told that you understand how difficult it is as a carer  that it its possible to ring day or night to get an update It would also be helpful if the info on notice boars in file in family room was up to date  Carers are losing all control when the young person enters the unit  are likely to be desperate to know hat is happening on a day to day basis   There are a lot of ill staff  sometimes messageinfo is not passed to other staff  Do not know about carers assessment I have not been told about any support services  The dining room is extremely echoy  very difficult to discuss caretreatmentchecking in

Service Quality/Outcomes,The whole experience of the ED service has been most unsatisfactory We have had to fight every step of the way to get any sort of service for our daughter who is 19 Originally we had to contact our local MP and complaint to the Trust to get any sort of move on a placement for our daughter Our first experience of the service in Novemember 2015 was poor and steadily went down hill from there I had to push for my daughter to have an initail referral to inpatient services in 2016 as her key worker seemed happy to invite her for a follow up appointment two weeks later when her BMI was below 15 Our daugher was in an ED hospital for 8 months but when she came out all that was on offer was a once weekly appointment at Bassetlaw hospital Having come from a 247 service this simply wasnt enough Her psychologist was given clear guidelines regarding the point at which our daughter should be rereferred to inpatient services at her review which we attended The consultant psychiatrist told her that if our daughters BMI reached 15 then an immediate rereferral should be made This did not happen and after my daughter started to express concerns about relapsing and allowed me to weigh her I discovered that her BMI was 137 and no referral had been made When then had to contact the ED service and ask for a referral to be made We were given an appointment with the psychiatrist in Nottingham 1 hour away from where we live and are now waiting for a critical bed to come up We have been informed that this is likely to be in Glasgow any day now as our daughter has become dangerously unwell This Trust has no regular day service for ED There is no crisis intervention service for ED so nobody to take a call at evenings or weekends when a crisis arises On the one occasion when we were in one such crisis we called the Bassetlaw mental health crisis intervention team They agreed to see our daughter at Bassetlaw AE Whilst the therapist who saw our daughter was very kind she inadvertently triggered our daughters anorexia due to a lack of experience of ED and made her much worse The money that must be spent funding beds in other health authorities must be extortionate It would be a fraction of this cost to provide more regular day care specialised services We were informed by Leicestershire NHS that had we lived in or around Leicester our daughter would have been able to access the day unit attached to their inpatient ED service following discharge She may have had a better chance of longterm recovery and not required a further inpatient placement Once again this would surely have saved the Trust money If this scenario is being played out over and over again the Trust must be losing huge amounts of money each year at the cost and wellbeing of the patients

Communication,You could make the patient who needs help feel more wanted and feel comfortable actually coming in to speak with the counsellors Also if a patient decides to walk out because of being angry about you counsellors not listening to what they actually want to occur which they think would help them instead of you guys putting in place complete opposite ideas and meetings to what is actually needed then you should actually make an effort to ask the patient what they want and to improve and to not let the patient feel like they arent wanted in the clinic Especially as you have the so called risk results and if they are above average  you shouldnt just ignore the care they need and not book further meetings just because you think its not needed because the patient hasnt opened up in the first meeting I mean it takes a lot to trust someone so I dont understand how you expect someone to open up about so much of there mental state in 1 session Enough of the negativity nice people but dont seem qualified to the full potential which is needed for mental care Also the counsellors dont listen to what you say half the time and mix up your words to what they think youre saying which leads to other counsellors being confused of the situation and what you have or havent said

Access to Services,Had to wait to get assessed which when you are feeling unwell is the last thing you want Only spoke over the phone with therapist which felt quite inpersonal the sessions sometimes felt rushed or cut short and made me feel I was one of many just to get through Once when I had to cancel an appointment and was told would be contacted to make another the next thing I received was a letter saying I would be discharged back to my doctor if I was not in touch within 14 days received two of these letters  lack of communication The therapist who I spoke to helped me think of things differently and sent me some notes on health anxiety which were helpful Overall I think improvements can be made to make your service better

Care/ Treatment,I have answered poor in response to question 7  however I believe the service in my case was very restricted due to the fact that I am only  on remand and have been for 9 months I am very pleased  and have a great deal of respect for the team which has been seeingtalking to me but I have now spent so much time due to my remand status without a tailormade package that I now feel it is far too late i feel much worse ACCT Reviews  I realise that ACCT revies do not really fall within your remit but I have several concerns as do many other women regards same 1 therre does not appear to be a great deal of  continuity  in that in my case at least different members of staff have attended each time this leads to women having to relate exactly the same thoughts and worries time and time again a process that leaves women with the impression that they have not been listened to in the first instance  resulting in a lack of confidence in the ACCT process itself In my case for example you do not selfharm do you has been asked at several reviews In actual fact I do  and this has been or so I thought documented many months ago Other women have given me several more examples We all find this embarrassing to discuss when we are all at our lowest ebb  without having to relate time and time again 2 We all feel that women should not be outnumbered by men at an ACCT review  I have yet to meet an inmate who is happy about this Continuity should and could be maintained by having at least one member of staff being present at an inmates review each and every time  if officers cannot attend then perhaps a A nurse b IMB member C Listener etc or perhaps postpone an ACCT review so that the inmates personal officer can be in attendence each time that is assuming tha thte inmate would agree to it and gets on with them  not all prisoners do 4 All ACCT reviews should be held in a more appropriate setting  and not in an office with constant interruptions Every woman I have spoken to has mentioned that a The interruptions upset them b they cannot concentrate and feel uncomfortable and in the way c They feel you are not concentrating on what they say and therefore they are an after thought when they are feeling at their worst  and  depressed and suicidal d They feel hurried and that you have more important things to do  undermining them 5 When officers conduct checks on women durng the night it would be a good idea if they all followed a set procedure  1 Put night light on first if no response 2 put main light on if no response 3 then knock if no response 4 then shoutsome officers are unnecesarily noisy and disturb everyone else on the wing  leading to the person on the ACCT being confronted the next morning This is the last thing they need when depressed and suicidal A bit more consideration would go a long way Not only that I believe sleep deprivation is the root cause of a great deal of the stress and anxiety many prisoners feel We work from 9am to 5pm and should all be allowed the opportunity of uninterrupted sleep  as the officers are I feel that all inmates  wehter sentenced or on  remand should be assessed and treated equally Many inmates  such as myself  are on remand for many months  some for over a year Please beleive me when I tell you that many of these women need help immdediately  this is mainly due to the fact that when on remand EVERYTHING is so uncertain and frightening PS I have been waiting since 25th october 12 for new prescription glasses  so please excuse my scribble I can only just read it myself pps I am aware that the opticians are from a private company out of your control
